## Built With

- React.js, Redux, Webpack, Babel

- HTML5/CSS3, Javascript ES6
- JWT authentication (back end generated)
- ESlint, Stylelint
- VSCode

## User Story (Demo):

### User will access the URL

- The can Signup in the app with email, name, password, password repeat.
- Since the email address us used as the ID for the user account, the signup workflow, attempts to validate the email against a API end point. If the email exists, the the App will show a little warning icon on the input field.
- Accounts can be created with the Role of Admin and User. This is only for the demo. The application currently ony shows the Admin workflow. You can still login as User, although you have no authorization for the admin views.
- If the account the account exists you can login with credentials. The app will validate the email address for in this instance.
- After Admin login, the app will display the admin index page, showing a catalog of existing applications.
- When a user selects an applicant, detailed information about the applicant is presented. (Mandatory)
  - Applicant Name
  - Picture (currently hosted in AWS S3)
  - Basic application details
  - Current admin evaluation for the applicant (if any).
- When the Admin, tap/click on an application, a more detailed page will be open with the application info.
- In the detail page, the Admin can evaluate the application as Appoved or Declined. All this actions are consumed back in the API where all records are stored for the current Admin and application.
- In the Admin index page, the main filter can be used to select and show the Approved, Declined or all applications applications.
- Since this information is stored in the back end, this approved/declined records persist per user.

## API Endpoints

The application uses JWT authentications, to handle any request after successful login. Each token has a 4 expiration time and after that, the used is prompted to log back again on any new request to the backend.

### Below is a list of the API end points used by this application.

## Front end design inspiration

The application front end is inspired in the work of [Alexey Savitskiy on Behance](https://www.behance.net/alexey_savitskiy)

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- To install the app in your system, make sure you have node/npm installed. [get npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Setup

- Clone the repository in your system by using:

`git clone `

## Install

- Next step is to CD into the local repository and run:

`npm install`

### start development mode in your local environment

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm build`

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Run tests

- Run the test suite app for store actions with
  ```
  $ npm test
  ```
